Using a [Capacity Constrained Point Distributions](http://graphics.uni-konstanz.de/publikationen/index.html#y2009), an algorithm by Michael Balzer, Thomas Schlömer & Oliver Deussen (University of Konstanz, Germany, 2009) to display a picture of a train.  

This is a variant of the original algorithm by Michael Balzer, Thomas Schlömer & Oliver Deussen (University of Konstanz, Germany, 2009), in which I a Voronoi Diagram is used to create a topology of the current sites, and only swap the points between neighbouring sites (and neighbours of neighbours). It appears to be much faster than the original algorithm.
